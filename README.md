# Osti Real-Time Recommendations

This holds the code for the real-time implementaiton of the Osti algorithm for music recommendations.

The basis of this repo is the [SpeedySloth Apple Watch tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/workouts_and_activity_rings/build_a_workout_app_for_apple_watch) from Apple. All credit is given to them for the basis of this application, and it is used in accordance with their License.

This repo extends upon this basic workout application to integrate Osti's recommendation system, and to communicate with the Spotify API to skip songs when appropriate.
